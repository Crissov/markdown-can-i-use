layout: page
title:  Blank Line Before Heading
---

tags: headings, whitespace

Classic markdown syntax does not require a blank line before a heading. 
The reason for the requirement is that it is all too easy for a # to end up at the beginning of a line by accident 
(perhaps through line wrapping). Consider, for example:

```
I like several of their flavors of ice cream:
#22, for example, and #5.
```
