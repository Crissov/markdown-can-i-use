# Extension: Inline Notes

Inline footnotes are also allowed (though, unlike regular notes, they cannot contain multiple paragraphs). 
The syntax is as follows:

```
Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]
```

Inline and regular footnotes may be mixed freely.
